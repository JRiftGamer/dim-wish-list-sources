Do all rounds above the mag size should get the damage buff? Seems like an easy way to consistently get +27.5% without every manually reloading.  \n#test whether Reconstruction + Reservoir Burst often beats Envious Arsenal + Bait and Switch. Both combinations theoretically give ~30% damage buff. But theoretically damage buff from Reconstruction + Reservoir Burst will always be ready immediately on enterring combat, whereas Envious Arsenal + Bait and Switch requires at least two weapon swaps to activate.",
